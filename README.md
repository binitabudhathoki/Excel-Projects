# "yearly budget tracking"
hello 
my project is about yearly budget tracking. it contains as follows:-
waterfall chart: - Shows how values increase/decrease over time
Used in: - Budget Tracking
funnel chart:Shows drop-off across process stages
Used in: - Customer Journey
piechart: To show the relative proportion of different categories in a dataset.
When there are few categories (ideally less than 6).
When exact percentage comparisons are important.
When labels and values are easy to distinguish.


donot chart:When you want a modern, cleaner look with a center space.
To show proportions while allowing space in the center for extra labels or text.
When comparing multiple datasets (e.g., side-by-side donut charts).
For dashboard visualizations (less cluttered than pie charts).
