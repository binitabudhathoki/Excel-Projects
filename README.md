# Yearly Budget Tracking
i have created a project about yearly budget tracking. it contains:
<h1>waterfall chart</h1>: - Shows how values increase/decrease over time.in my project i have choosen for the same reason to show the increase and decrease trend.
<h1>funnel chart</h1>:Shows drop-off across process stages. 
Used in: - Customer Journey
<h1>piechart</h1: To show the relative proportion of different categories in a dataset.
When there are few categories (ideally less than 6).
When exact percentage comparisons are important.
When labels and values are easy to distinguish.


<h1>donot chart</h1>h1>:When you want a modern, cleaner look with a center space.
To show proportions while allowing space in the center for extra labels or text.
When comparing multiple datasets (e.g., side-by-side donut charts).
For dashboard visualizations (less cluttered than pie charts).
